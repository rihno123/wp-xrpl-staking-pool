Setup: 
       1. First of all, you need to configure the settings, you need to enter your own Xaman api key 
          and api secret key, token name and token's issuer account, furthermore you need staking
          wallet's secret key, if "Enable testing" is checked, than payout will happen in matter
          of seconds, otherwise you need to wait time you set up.

       2. Create a Form in elementor and set id to "Form"

       2. Form must have one input field with id "amount" which is used for defining staking amount and 
          another one with id "period"(you can also use "Select" instead of an input field) which has 
          to be in format like this example: "3 months 3%" or similiar,you can use any time frame and 
          percentage you want, but be sure to put timeframe in months.
