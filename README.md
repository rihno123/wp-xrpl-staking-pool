1. **Configure the Settings**
   - Enter your Xaman API key and API secret key.
   - Specify the token name and the token's issuer account.
   - Provide the staking wallet's secret key.
   - If "Enable testing" is checked, payouts will occur within seconds. Otherwise, payouts will follow the time frame you set.
