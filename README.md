# XRPL Staking Pool
Setup: 1. Create a Form in elementor and set id to "Form"



       2. Form must have an one input field with id "field1" and another one with id "period" (you can also use "Select" instead of a input field) which has to be in format like this example: "3 months 3%", you can use any time frame and percentage you want, but be sure to put timeframe in months.

That's it,Enjoy!
